# US_Bikeshare
Udacity Project US Bikeshare

This this repository is meant to manage my Project "US Bikeshare" in the Udacity Nanodegree "Programming for Datascience with Python"

bikeshare.py: This is the main file which contains all functions to filter the test data

other .py files: All other .py files are just for development reasons to develop the required subfunctions inside bikeshare.py
